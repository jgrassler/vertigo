REQUIREMENTS:
    - ant           (no version requirements?)
    - java 1.6	    (currently works with both Sun's JDK; 
                     and OpenJDK)

BUILD:
    - run `make` (or `ant` : Makefile is just a wrapper)

    if you have problems finding jni.h, use:
	make CFLAGS=-I/path/to/javahome/include
    or just install libgcj-devel (jni.h versions are similar). For
    many linux systems, the following seems to be the right invocation:
	make CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include"

    For Debian Wheezy on an amd64 system the following should work:

      # aptitude install ant openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-source                 # Install build prerequisites
      # CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include" make           # build

INSTALL:

      # make install                                                        # If you have no problems finding jni.h
      # CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include" make install         # Fixes jni.h issue on many Linux systems
      # CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include" make install   # Fixes jni.h issue on Debian Wheezy/amd64

    This puts scripts and jars into a specified $prefix.
    

CONFIG:
    Build a default configuration with:
    veconfig generate <config.xml>

    List the contents of the config.xml:
    veconfig dump <config.xml>

    The best way to edit the config is to run vertigo (below)
    and use vectl to to issue commands to the running vertigo.

RUN: 
    To run vertigo:
        vertigo config.xml

    Then, give the following commands (deleting VTs implicitly deletes the rules
    associated with them):

	vectl deleteSlice alice

	vectl deleteSlice bob

    where vectl is the VeRTIGO's configuration tool, a modified version of the
    original FlowVisor's fvctl script with some additional options that can 
    be used to define and instantiate Virtual Links.

    You can now define a new VT called charlie that will catch all flows from 
    all switches with commands:

    vectl createSlice charlie tcp:yourhost.com:10001 slice-email@yourhost.com

    vectl addFlowSpace any 10 any "Slice:charlie=4"


BUILD WITH ECLIPSE:
    After the above installation process, import the project in eclipse and set 
    the following Run/Debug settings:
	
	Program arguments: config.xml
	VM arguments: 
	  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/usr/local/etc/vertigo/mySSLKeyStore 
	  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=CHANGEME_PASSWD
